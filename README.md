```

## Props
| Prop                  | Default      | Required | Description                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :----------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `animation_library`      | `reanimated` | false    | The animation library that you would like to choose. At the moment, we make use of [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and the built-in Animated API |
| `small_source`        |              | true     | The source for the smallest image that will initially be blurred and animated out   |
| `large_source`        |              | true     | The source for the larger image that we will be lazily loading                      |
| `initial_blur_radius` | `3`          | false    | The initial blur amount for the small image. Only present until the large image has been loaded and animates in. |
| `use_native_driver`   | `true`       | false    | Specify whether you would like to use the native driver for animations. Recommended to leave this untouched as `true` is the default value. This is only applicable if and when `animation_library` is `animated` |
| `style`               |              | false    | The style of the image container. Images use `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject`, so define your desired style here. |
| `animation_duration`  | `350`        | false    | The transition duration. Only applicable when using `reanimated` or `animated` with `type` prop equal to `timing`. |
| `type`                | `timing`     | false    | The type of animation to use. Either `spring` or `timing`.                          |
| `timing_config`       |              | false    | The configuration for the Animated.timing (Animated API) animation.                 |
| `spring_config`       |              | false    | The configuration for the Animated.spring (Animated API) animation.                 |
| `in_easing`           |              | false    | Only applicable when using `reanimated` for `animation_library`, this is the easing that is applied as the small image fades out. |
| `out_easing`          |              | false    | Only applicable when using `reanimated` for `animation_library`, this is the easing that is applied as the large image fades in.  |
