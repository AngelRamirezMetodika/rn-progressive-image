## Installation
---
<br>

```bash
$ npm install rn-progressive-image
```
<br>

**Note**: This package makes use of other packages, specifically [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient). In order for this to work properly, you **must** follow the installation instructions for those packages. Not following these instructions will result in the package not working.

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-linear-gradient
```

## Usage
---
<br>

Import the package as follows:
```javascript
import ProgressiveImage from 'rn-progressive-image'
```
<br>

At the core, this is the simplest form of usage is as follows:
```javascript
    <ProgressiveImage 
        source={{ uri: https://myimageprovider.com/myImagePath.jpg }}
    />
```

| `style`               | A square that is equal to half of the device's width with a gray background. | false | Images use `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject`, so define your desired style here and the images will automatically be set to cover the defined view. |
| `thumbnailSource`     |              | false    | The source for the thumbnail image which will be used for the placeholder. This is only applicable when `placeholder` is `Thumbnail` |
| `blurRadius`          | `3`          | false    | The blurRadius for the thumbnailImage. This is only applicable when `placeholder` is `Thumbnail` |

| `inEasing`           | `Easing.bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` | false | This is the easing that is applied as the placeholder transitions out. |
| `outEasing`           | `Easing.bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` | false | This is the easing that is applied to the source image as it transitions in. |
| `animationDuration`   | `350`        | false    | The transition duration for the image source fading in and the placeholder fading out. |

<br>
This section details any changes that have been implemented across versions. It will be starting with version 3.0.0 as that is the most recent version.
<br>
<br>

### 3.0.0
* Added the ability to switch between two different types of progressive loading, `Shimmer` or `Thumbnail`
* Removed the unused component from the view hierarchy after the desired source has been loaded.
* Generated typings with comments for better adoption.
* Updated prop names (breaking change).
* Wrote a custom `ShimmerEffect` component which is built on Reanimated with the usage of `react-native-linear-gradient`
* Implemented new build features which streamline the building process and allow for better build outputs.
* Removed the usage of React Native's built-in Animated API.
* Removed the ability to use different configurations such as `Spring`

## Considerations
---
<br>

Some decisions have been made (for now), which are to omit the addition of caching. While I believe that caching is important, I am uncertain if I want to include it in this package by default. And having it be another prop that you must define to use the package seems sloppy. However, in the future, it is possible that a new component could be added that introduces caching (e.g. `CachedProgressiveImage`).

I've had some time to think about the best way to do this and I have two potential routes. One might include the use of [react-native-async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage), where the base64 of an image is retrieved and a cache method is implemented to store the base64 of the image. This would be an object that gets stored as stringified JSON:

```javascript
{
    key: 'CACHE_KEY',
    type: 'Thumbnail' | 'Original Source',
    base64: Base64 data
}
```
<br>

The other method involves the use of [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob). This is used for retrieving the base64 of an image and has its own caching system. However, there are some nuances around the caching system of this package as it does not include any built-in cache flushing functionality.

Thoughts on how to implement this are as follows, but are not complete. To do this, we could add an additional package that would help us achieve the desired behavior. The thought is to potentially include something such as [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob). It has built-in caching functionality, however, there would
